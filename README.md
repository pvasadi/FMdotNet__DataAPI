# FMdotNet__DataAPI
.NET wrapper (.NET Standard 2.0) around the FileMaker Server REST Data API.  

FileMaker Server 16 introduced a new RESTful Data API.  This .NET wrapper makes it easy for any .NET developer to interact with that Data API without having to know the endpoints or understand the structure of the returned JSON.

The original fmDotNet was a wrapper around the FileMaker Server XML API and is still valid.  It is available here on GitHub and as a NuGet package.
